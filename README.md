# Intermediate-Statistics
This repo houses the scripts, datasets, and slides I created for the graduate level human data Intermediate Statisitcs course I TA'd and taught labs for at LSU.

Lab10 - Designed to simulate data. Unlike the previous labs, this lab gave the students a completed script and we walked through how to assess code to derive what it is doing. The idea for this week is to teach how to understand code that someone else has written.

Lab12 - Similar to Lab10, the script was not written with the students but instead was written ahead of time and given to the students to walk through together. Two similar studies are preprocessed and analyzed. The code for one study uses base R and the other study code uses the Tidyverse.
